# Harness RSI Evidence Dataset

## Status and purpose

**v0.2.0 — released October 31, 2026.** Maintained by the Harness RSI project team as a companion to *From Harness Optimization to Recursive Self-Improvement: A Survey of Language Model Agents*. Xin Yu leads the project. Codex assisted search, extraction and validation; it is not a scholarly author. No additional funding is asserted for this dataset release.

This resource documents what agent harnesses change, how changes are selected, what outcomes are reported, and what the evidence cannot establish. It is a curated evidence collection, not a new benchmark or a collection of reproduced experiments.

## Composition and coverage

| Quantity | v0.1.0 | v0.2.0 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Category-source records | 95 | 113 |
| Distinct works | 63 | 81 |
| Records with structured signals | 4 | 22 |
| Scoped signals | 6 | 24 |
| Newly documented primary-source checks | Not claimed | 28 |
| Inherited records without a new primary audit | 95 | 85 |
| Populated selection/control fields | 0 | 28 |
| Independently human-adjudicated records | Not claimed | 0 |

The 81 works comprise 80 papers and one benchmark resource. A paper can appear in several categories; records and signals are not independent experimental effects. Eighteen records were added; six existing records received source-version/mechanism checks without inventing outcome signals. The four original pilot records were checked against primary text.

Targeted discovery runs through **October 31, 2026**. The original snapshot retains its **October 1** membership cutoff; new sources and revisions have individual dates. The search horizon does not imply every record was re-audited or the field was exhaustively covered. The broader bibliography is a separate collection.

The dataset has coding, reasoning, interactive, visual and cross-domain entries. The new cross-domain category holds aggregate comparisons that cannot be assigned to one task category without distortion. The historical four-domain atlas remains separately frozen.

## Collection and review

See `PROTOCOL.md` for eligibility and scientific distinctions. Discovery uses targeted primary-source search and reference following. `screening.json` records 21 candidate decisions: 18 empirical extractions and three contextual works. A complete search-result denominator was not recorded; no PRISMA completeness or recall estimate is claimed.

Evidence uses pinned papers and locators. First release, inspected revision, metadata check and claim review are distinct dates. Full third-party papers are not distributed. Short support anchors and hashes identify inspected HTML renderings; arXiv can regenerate HTML without changing the PDF version.

`primary_source_checked` means AI-assisted inspection of the specified claim, protocol and limitations. It is not experimental reproduction or independent dual annotation. The 85 inherited records remain `legacy_curated`. Human adjudication is pending; no agreement statistic is fabricated. Automatic excerpt matching checks traceability, not scientific truth.

## Files and loading

`dataset.json` and `records.jsonl` preserve the nested representation; `schema.json` specifies it. `primary-checked.records.jsonl` contains only the 28 targeted primary-checked records. Six of these are version/mechanism reviews without a structured outcome; use `signals.csv` for the 24 outcome observations. This subset is not independently human-adjudicated.

`sources.json`, `screening.json`, `search-log.json`, `corrections.json`, `quality-report.json`, `citation.bib` and `checksums.json` accompany every version. The search log is a partial retrospective record, not a complete search-result archive.

Normalized tables avoid nested JSON strings inside CSV cells:

| Table | Unit and joins |
| --- | --- |
| `papers.csv` | One work, keyed by `key` |
| `records.csv` | One category-source record, keyed by `id`, linked by `key` |
| `signals.csv` | One observation, keyed by `signal_id`, linked by `record_id` |
| `record_sources.csv` | Source version and locator per record |
| `record_benchmarks.csv` | Record/benchmark membership and role |
| `record_controls.csv` | One inspected control condition per record |
| `signal_components.csv` | Signal/component relation |
| `signal_benchmarks.csv` | Explicit signal applicability |
| `reviews.csv` | Review provenance per record |
| `review-queue.csv` | 85 primary-source reviews and 28 human-adjudication tasks; reviewer fields are blank |

Flat JSONL files for papers, all records, the primary-checked subset and signals support separate HF configurations. The split is called `data`; no training/test partition is invented. Randomly splitting related literature rows would not produce a valid model benchmark.

```python
import json
from pathlib import Path
data = json.loads(Path("dataset.json").read_text())
for record in data["records"]:
    if record["review"]["status"] == "primary_source_checked":
        for signal in record["signals"]:
            if signal["outcome"] in {"regression", "no_gain", "mixed"}:
                print(record["id"], signal["summary"], signal["primary_support"]["url"])
```

Retain the versioned files, manifest and HF commit. A moving `main` or `latest.json` is not a reproducibility pin.

## Fields and missingness

- `annotation_status`: `record_screened` has signals; `record_reviewed_no_signal` has a version/mechanism check without a newly coded outcome; `not_reviewed` lacks a current structured-label pass.
- `selection_protocol`, `controlled_variables`: extracted only where inspected. Null plus `not_assessed` means not extracted, not absent in the paper. Controls apply to the stated comparison.
- `weight_update_boundary`: fixed executor, trained auxiliary policy, trained executor or unassessed. Fixed executor does not certify every component is frozen.
- `transfer_regime`: distinguishes same-model benchmark transfer, held-out models, target adaptation, transductive evaluation, sequential probes and other stated settings.
- Signal `outcome`: improvement, regression, no gain, mixed or not assessed, always with a comparison and scope.
- `retention`: retained, rejected, rolled back, not reported or not assessed. Acceptance in one round is not final retention.
- `attribution`: whole system, ablation, proposal test, edit outcome, usage, case or unassessed. These are designs, not a quality ranking.
- `evidence_quote` is an excerpt of our curated narrative; `primary_support.excerpt` is a short exact normalized-text anchor in the primary paper.
- Empty benchmark applicability does not mean every benchmark. Unknown dates remain null or retain original precision.

## Corrections

HarnessX's `unused-color-tool` is superseded by `color-tool-zero-hit-rate`: the paper measures affected tasks flipped to success, not tool invocation frequency. Zero is a scoped edit outcome, not an isolated causal test. See arXiv:2606.14249v3, Figures 8 and 10, and `corrections.json`.

EvolveNet, TTHE, ModularRSI, RRSI and HarnessPAI have migrated versions/locators in six records. The old unpinned ModularRSI code observation is not represented as a current code audit. The Lean cost/time comparison is restricted to its common-solved subset. Historical v0.1.0 files remain unchanged; apply these correction notices when interpreting them.

## Uses, biases and limitations

Use the collection to trace design changes, compare evaluation practices and locate reporting gaps. Filter by review status and scope. Group repeated sources when analyzing studies. Human review is advisable before using an annotation as a pivotal scholarly claim.

The corpus is selected, English-dominant, rapidly changing and subject to publication and survivorship bias. Unsuccessful edits can be absent from papers. The review sample is purposive, not random, so its error rate cannot be extrapolated. Models, budgets, tasks, selection access and denominators differ. Do not pool raw improvements, rank methods on one leaderboard, treat empty signals as no failures, or estimate a global intervention success rate.

Public author names and attribution are retained. No private emails, credentials, private correspondence or participant-level data are distributed; no sensitive personal attributes are inferred. The collection does not establish the safety of autonomous self-modification.

## Rights, citation and maintenance

Use the exact version in `citation.bib`. No dataset DOI, peer-review certification or acceptance is claimed. Report corrections through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/LucasXinYu/harness-rsi/issues) with record ID, source version, locator and interpretation. New releases require review, validation and preserved history. No unattended update cadence is guaranteed.
